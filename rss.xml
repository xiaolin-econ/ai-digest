  <description>Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising approach for language modeling, yet they face a performance gap compared to autoregressive models (ARMs) and require more training iterations. In this work, we present the Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion (ARMD) model, an architecture designed to close this gap by unifying the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel generation capabilities of diffusion-based models. Our key insight is to reframe the masked diffusion process as a block-wise causal model. This perspective allows us to design a strictly causal, permutation-equivariant architecture that computes all conditional probabilities across multiple denoising steps in a single, parallel forward pass. The resulting architecture supports efficient,…</description>

  <description>arXiv cs.AI - Multi-agent systems (MAS) have recently emerged as promising socio-collaborative companions for emotional and cognitive support. However, these systems frequently suffer from persona collapse--where agents revert to generic, homogenized assistant behaviors--and social sycophancy, which produces redundant, non-constructive dialogue. We propose MASCOT, a generalizable framework for multi-perspective</description>

  <description>arXiv cs.AI - Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in extending large language models into agentic systems. While the effectiveness of agents has continued to improve, efficiency, which is crucial for real-world deployment, has often been overlooked. This paper therefore investigates efficiency from three core components of agents: memory, tool learning, and planning, considering costs such as latenc</description>

  <description>arXiv cs.AI - Writing effective rebuttals is a high-stakes task that demands more than linguistic fluency, as it requires precise alignment between reviewer intent and manuscript details. Current solutions typically treat this as a direct-to-text generation problem, suffering from hallucination, overlooked critiques, and a lack of verifiable grounding. To address these limitations, we introduce $\textbf{Rebutta</description>
